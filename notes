# Model Development Summary

1. **Standardized Project Structure**  
   Moved all scripts into a single `deep_learning` folder so paths are consistent and everything runs smoothly.

2. **Model Choice**  
   Used **ConvNeXt-Base** with transfer learning. Started by freezing the backbone, then fine-tuned gradually to adapt to skin lesion images.

3. **Handling Class Imbalance**  
   Majority classes were dominating, so we added **Focal Loss**, class weights, and heavy data augmentation.

4. **Better Training Behavior**  
   Avoided baseline models (EfficientNet/ResNet) that gave misleading accuracy spikes. The new model learns steadily and reliably.

5. **Improved Generalization**  
   Focused the model on the lesions instead of background clutter using color jittering and normalization tweaks.

6. **Checkpointing & Deployment**  
   Saved the best models systematically, including metadata, so they’re ready for inference right away.
