# Model Development Summary

1. **Project Standardization:** Unified all scripts under a single root directory (`deep_learning`) to ensure path consistency and reproducibility.
2. **Architecture Selection:** Implemented **ConvNeXt-Base** using transfer learning—initially freezing the backbone before performing gradual fine-tuning for domain adaptation.
3. **Class Imbalance Mitigation:** Addressed significant bias toward majority classes by implementing **Focal Loss**, class weighting, and robust data augmentation.
4. **Training Optimization:** Moved beyond baseline models (EfficientNet/ResNet) that showed artificial accuracy spikes to a model with a healthy, gradual learning curve.
5. **Generalization & Robustness:** Improved model focus on skin lesions rather than background features through specialized normalization and color jittering.
6. **Checkpointing & Deployment:** Established a systematic saving process for the best-performing models, including metadata for immediate inference readiness.
